# hello-world
This is me, Joy Febe.
I'm a law student, yet have so many things to be curious about. 
I use my time to read regulations and updated law issues, but sometimes it gets boring. So I chose to learn and do other student's activity, such as coding, web development, learning new language, among others. 
I know my ability towards technology isn't that good. even my family told me that I'm "gaptek", but I think there's nothing wrong in the process of learning. 
after all, I know there's so many things I can learn in this pandemic, so I hope that this "hobby" to learn something new will give me a good result. even though it's not useful for my job in the near future, yet I'm still happy.
